# Delaunay-Triangulation
Algorithm of delaunay triangluation, implemented for Computational Geometry on the 2nd year of Computational Engineering

Program gets a coloured image of digital material microstructure and triangulate a domain with Delaunay algorithm. Export the mesh in other format, to process it in other program. Useful with Finite Element Method. Visualisation created in cv2. Whole project is written in python.
